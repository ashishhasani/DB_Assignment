        <h3>Assumptions</h3>

        <p>
            For <strong>Sparklines</strong> I have assumed that data is coming every second and therefore
            I have drawn it with latest 30 values considering 1 value per second.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>

        <p>
            I have started with defining table structure. After that added one row for each currency pair
            and then updated them with latest values.
        </p>
        <p>
            After receiving every object, sorted the table on Last Change Bid
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally added Sparkline functionality with 30 latest values assuming that we are getting data every second.
        </p>
        <h3>Frameworks/Libraries would like to use</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>AngularJS</strong> would be helpful to do this because of its data-binding nature.
            Also <strong>Bootstrap</strong> would have helped to make it more responsive.
